  插图：It is responsible to plan for the future, to save for emergencies, to make sure that we don't become a burden on others as a result of our own incompetence, greed or self-indulgence.We ought particularly to think of our own and our parents' old age, when there could be many big health care bills. What has made China great today is that her people have saved, whereas in the West huge personal debt was a major cause of the 2008 financial crisis.Because China has saved so much, she is now able to spend massive sums on improving her infrastructure, which not only lays the foundations for a more prosperous future but also keeps people in work today following the financial crisis. It is most unwise both personally and as a nation to get further and further into debt. If you do that, much of your present and future earnings have to be spent on interest payments to finance the debt. Reckless spending is a sign of a society in decay where greed and materialism have taken hold.Such a society can be neither socialist nor harmonious. Uncontrolled spending and speculation are the signs of the disorder caused by unregulated capitalism and lead to rapid price inflation and to "boom and bust" in the economy. They also destroy the economic stability that is essential for sensible economic planning and growth.</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
