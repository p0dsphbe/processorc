		　　李柯勇编*的《坐在岁月的屋脊上（英文版）》 digs out and salvages the personal stories of legendary figures in modern and contemporary tibet who experienced the change of government in tibet. it comprises nine stories including "divine artists," "two secular monks," "a rinpoche photographer," "a nobleman's vicissitudes of life" and "love and war." the author integrates historical records with private interviews and his own personal assessments, and follows through to their lives until the present. he includes a broad spectrum of people that enriches this historical data, and in doing so enables us to sense the tapestry that is tibetan culture. with nearly a hundred photos of the past and present of tibet, the book vividly displays the many facets of this period. the author's personal deep respect for tibet and tibetans is the thread that makes this book special and worth reading.
