The book introduces a numerical method, which integrates the viscous flow theory and potential flowtheory, to solve the hydrodynamic problem of a damaged ship upon flooding. The interactive dynamics between ship hull, external sea wave, water flooding and water sloshing are analyzed. The main findings in this book could assist in understanding of the intricate flooding mechanism that remains limited for ship researchers, designers and safety authorities.
