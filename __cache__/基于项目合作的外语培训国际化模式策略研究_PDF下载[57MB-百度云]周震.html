This book aims to develop and test a project-based foreign language training model for Chinese employees. The model aims to develop the ability of foreign language training suppliers to establish a management strategy for project-based training involving international educational communication. It has generated a number of successful outcomes through the justification of the novel model which include individual project creation, developing foreign language programmes, training needs analysis, pedagogic design, joint evaluation and decision making. These contributions will add updated knowledge to education management and also enable further value to international educational institutions and practitioners.</p>]<p><h2>作者简介</h2></p>[<p>Dr. Zhou Zhen is a professor of English at Ningxia University.
