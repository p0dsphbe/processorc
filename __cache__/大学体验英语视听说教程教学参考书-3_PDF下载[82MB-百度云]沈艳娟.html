  插图：So Einstein's brain has given up some of its secrets to Mark and Jim. In the battle of biology versus ideas, Jim and Mark have each scored points. Seemingly, Einstein was born with overlaps in his brain. These overlaps may have meant maths and spatial thinking were more intuitive to him.Thinking like a child let him see the world in a unique way. And his unique, perhaps autistic, levelof concentration, forced his brain to expand like a muscle. Extra glial cells were needed to cope withthe extra demand, possibly helping make the maths area in the brain more than 15% wider thannormal. All these effects united to give Einstein a mind unlike any other, perhaps the greatest mindin history. In the future, could we preserve a genius like Einstein in something better than the jar？Imagine a brave new world, where a genius' brain could be copied onto silicon using microscopicrobots called nanobots. This is the vision of the futurologist Ray Kurzweil."I think by the 2020s or the late 2020s, we will have completely reverse engineered the brainand understand how all the different regions work. It'll take us longer to be able to scan the entirebrain and get capture of every detail of someone's personality. The blood vessels of the brain goeverywhere, and so if we send billions of nanobots through the capillaries of the brain, they can scaneverything in the brain of a specific person at very high resolution. Then you could create a machine,a non-biological entity, that would simulate a specific person's brain and that simulation will act justlike that person, and if you then talk to that simulation, you'd be convinced that it was that person.""I am little worried about whether I'm talking to the real Ray or he's at home having a cup of tea.""Well, I worry about that too. Once we understand the basic principles of operation of how thebrain works, we Can take a brain-like system and expose it to a complicated problem and the systemwill learn on its own. It can actually do it thousands maybe eventually millions of times faster than areal human brain and actually develop skills that are far greater than a human being is able to."So a future Einstein could be put on a computer, literally a ghost in the machine."Do you believe that, you know, just by looking at that, genius is —— or genius is something elsefor you？</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
