  插图：In many businesses, computers have largely replacedpaper work, because they are fast, flexible, and do not makemistakes. As one banker said, "Unlike humans, computersnever have a bad day." And they are honest. Many banksadvertise that their transactions are "unlocked by humanhands" and therefore safe from human temptation. Obviously,computers have no reason to steal money. But they also haveno conscience, and the growing number of computer crimesshows they can be used to steal.Computer criminals don't use guns. And even if they arecaught, it is hard to punish them because there are no witnessand often no evidence. A computer cannot remember who used it: it simply does what it is told.The head teller at a Salt Lake City bank used a computer to steal more than one and a half billiondollars in just four years. No one noticed this theft because she moved the money from oneaccount to another. Each time a customer she had robbed questioned the balance in his account,the teller claimed a computer error, then replaced the missing money from someone else's account.This person was caught only because she was a drug user. When the police broke up an illegaldrug operation, her name was in the records.Some employees use the computer's power to take revenge on employers they considerunfair. Recently, a large company fired its computer-tape-librarian for reasons that involved hispersonal rather than his professional life.</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
