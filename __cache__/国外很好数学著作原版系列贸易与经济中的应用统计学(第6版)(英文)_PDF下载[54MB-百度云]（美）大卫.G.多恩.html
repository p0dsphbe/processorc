As recently as a decade ago our students used to ask us， 'How do I use st*istics Today we more oftehear， 'Why should I use st*istics' Applied St*istics iBusiness and Economics has *tempted to provide real meaning to the use of st*istics iour world by using real business situ*ions and real d*a and appealing to your need to know why r*her tha*ust how.<br/>　　With over 50 yea* of teaching st*istics betweethe two of us， we feel we have something to offer. Seeing how students have changed as the new century unfolds has required us to adapt and seek out better ways of instru*ion. So we wrote Applied St*istics iBusiness and Economics to meet four distin* ob*e*ives.<br/>　　Ob*e*ive 1： Com*nic*e the Metuung of Vari*ioia Business Context Vari*ioe*sts everywhere ithe world around us. Successful businesses know how to measure vari*ion. They also know how to tell whevari*ioshould be responded to and wheit should be left alone. We'll show how businesses do this.As recently as a decade ago our students used to ask us， 'How do I use st*istics Today we more oftehear， 'Why should I use st*istics' Applied St*istics iBusiness and Economics has *tempted to provide real meaning to the use of st*istics iour world by using real business situ*ions and real d*a and appealing to your need to know why r*her tha*ust how.<br/>　　With over 50 yea* of teaching st*istics betweethe two of us， we feel we have something to offer.

Successful businesses know how to measure vari*ion. They also know how to tell whevari*ioshould be responded to and wheit should be left alone. We'll show how businesses do this.<br/>　　Ob*e*ive 2： Use Real D*a and Real Business Applic*ions Examples， case studies， and problems are takefrom published research or real applic*ions whenever possible. Hypothetical d*a are used wheit seems the best way to illustr*e a concept. You causually tell the difference by examining the foo*otes citing the source.<br/>　　Ob*e*ive 3：Incorpor*e Current St*istical Pra*ices and Offer Pra*ical Advice With the increased reliance o*pute*， st*istics pra*itione* have changed the way they use st*istical tools. We'll show the current pra*ices and exp*why they are used the way they are. We also will tell you wheeach technique should not be used.<br/>　　Ob*e*ive 4： Provide More In-Depth Explan*ioof the Why and Let the Software Take Care of the How It is critical to unde*tand the importance of **nic*ing with d*a. Today's *puter capabilities *ke it *ch easier to sum*rize and display d*a thaever before. We demonstr*e easily *stered software techniques using the *mosoftware available. We also spend a gre* deal of time othe idea th* there are risks idecisio*king and those risks should be quantified and dire*ly considered ievery business decision.<br/>　　Our experience tells us th* students want to be givecredit for the experience they bring to the college classroom， We have tried to honor this by choosing examples and exercises set isitu*ions th* will draw ostudents' already vast knowledge of the world and knowledge gained from other classes， Emphasis is othinking about d*a， choosing appropri*e analytic tools， using *pute* effe*ively， and recognizing limit*ions of st*istics.
