参考之用.
                                        </p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>本书是编者结合自己20余年普通物理教学经验（其中十余年的应用技术型本科教学经验）编写而成，内容结构合理，难点处理得当，尤其适合于应用技术型本科普通物理课程教学使用。主要有以下四点：一是考虑不同需求，内容划分层次。标有 “ ※”号的章节内容为自选内容，教师可以根据教学需求进行取舍，无论取与舍，都不影响内容的完整性和逻辑性。习题按难度分为A、B两类，学生可以根据自身情况选做对应难度的题目；二是注意过渡与衔接，方便学生的预习和自学。每部分内容开始都有引言，结束都有小结，构造出清晰的物理知识体系和脉络；三是注重学法指导，降低学习难度。对于中学相对陌生的内容，进行专门学习方法说明。如刚体一章开始即强调类比方法的运用，并编写了大量的类比表格；四是精选物理学家的故事作为阅读材料，激发学习兴趣，培养奋斗精神。 </p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
