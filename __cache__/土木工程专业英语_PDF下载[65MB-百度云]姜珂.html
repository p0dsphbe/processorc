  插图：Civil engineering is a professional engineering discipline, that deals with the design, constructionand maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including works such as bridges,roads, canals, dams and buildings. Civil engineering is the oldest engineering discipline aftermilitary engineering, and it was defined to distinguish non-military engineering from militaryengineering. It is traditionally broken into several sub-disciplines including 'environmentalengineering, geoteclmical engineering, structural engineering, transportation engineering, municipalor urban engineering, water resources engineering, materials engineering, coastal engineering,surveying, and construction engineering. Civil engineering takes place on all levels: in the publicsector from municipal through to federal levels, and in the private sector from individualhomeowners through to international companies.</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
