  WHEN Caroline Meeber boarded the afternoon train for Chicago, her totaloutfit consisted of a small trunk, a cheap imitation alligator-skin satchel, asmall lunch in a paper box, and a yellow leather snap purse, containing herticket, a scrap of paper with her sister's address in Van Buren Street, and fourdollars in money. It was in August, 1889. She was eighteen years of age,bright, timid, and full of the illusions of ignorance and youth. Whatever touchof regret at parting characterised her thoughts, it was certainly not foradvantages now being given up. A gush of tears at her mother's farewell kiss,a touch in her throat when the cars clacked by the flour mill where her fatherworked by the day, a pathetic sigh as the familiar green environs of the villagepassed in review, and the threads which bound her so lightly to girlhood andhome were irretrievably broken.  To be sure there was always the next station, where one might descend andreturn. There was the great city, bound more closely by these very trainswhich came up daily. Columbia City was not so very far away, even once shewas in Chicago. What, pray, is a few hours-a few hundred miles？ Shelooked at the little slip bearing her sister's address and wondered. She gazedat the green landscape, now passing in swift review, until her swifter thoughtsreplaced its impression with vague conjectures of what Chicago might be.  When a girl leaves her home at eighteen, she does one of two things. Eithershe falls into saving hands and becomes better, or she rapidly assumes thecosmopolitan standard of virtue and becomes worse. Of an intermediatebalance, under the circumstances, there is no possibility. The city has itscunning wiles, no less than the infinitely smaller and more human tempter.There are large forces which allure with all the soulfulness of expressionpossible in the most cultured human.</p>]<p><h2>作者简介</h2></p>[<p>
