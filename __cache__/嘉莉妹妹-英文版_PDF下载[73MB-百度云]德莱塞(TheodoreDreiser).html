She was eighteen years ofage, bright, timid, and full of the illusions of ignorance andyouth. Whatever touch of regret at parting characterizedher thoughts, it was certainly not for advantages now beinggiven up. A gush of tears at her mother's farewell kiss, atouch in her throat when the cars clacked by the flour millwhere her father worked by the day, a pathetic sigh as thefamiliar green environs of the village passed in review, andthe threads which bound her so lightly to girlhood and homewere irretrievably broken. To be sure there was always the next station, where onemight descend and return. There was the great city, boundmore closely by these very trains which came up daily.Columbia City was not so very far away, even once she wasin Chicago. What, pray, is a few hours——a few hundred miles？She looked at the little slip bearing her sister's address andwondered. She gazed at the green landscape, now passing inswift review, until her swifter thoughts replaced its impressionwith vague conjectures of what Chicago might be. When a girl leaves her home at eighteen, she does one oftwo things. Either she falls into saving hands and becomesbetter, or she rapidly assumes the cosmopolitan standardof virtue and becomes worse. Of an intermediate balance under the circumstances, there is no possibility. The cityhas its cunning wiles, no less than the infinitely smaller andmore human tempter. There are large forces which allurewith all the soulfulness of expression possible in the mostcultured human. The gleam of a thousand lights is often aseffective as the persuasive light in a wooing and fascinatingeye. Half the undoing of the unsophisticated and naturalmind is accomplished by forces wholly superhuman. A blareof sound, a roar of life. a vast array of human hives, appealto the astonished senses in equivocal terms. Without acounselor at hand to whisper cautious interpretations, whatfalsehoods may not these things breathe into the unguardedear！ </p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>

In 1892, when Dreiserbegan work as a newspaperman,he "began to observe a certaintype of crime in the United Statesthat proved very common. Itseemed to spring from the factthat almost every young personwas possessed of an ingrownambition to be somebodyfinancially and socially." 
　　He pioneered the naturalistschool and is known forportraying characters whose valuelies not in their moral code, butin their persistence against allobstacles, and literary situationsthat more closely resemblestudies of nature than tales ofchoice and agency.</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
