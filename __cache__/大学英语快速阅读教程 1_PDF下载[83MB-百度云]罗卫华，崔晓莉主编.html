When registered， you receive an NHS medical card， which you should take care not to lose!　　Libraries　　Most towns and cities will have at least one public library， which any one can join at little or no cost. As well as copies of national （and sometimes international） newspapers and magazines， many public libraries provide free access to the Internet and CD-ROMs. They'II also let you borrow recent novels and non-fiction books， and many will have music tapes and CDs （both popular and classical） and films on video that can be rented at a low cost.　　Schools for Children　　If you are bringing your family to the UK， your children under the age of sixteen can attend state schools without having to pay tuition fees. In most state schools boys and girls study together. School is required for children between the ages of five and sixteen， and the UK Government has pledged a nursery place for every four-year-old as long as their parents would like it.　　Student Bargains　　The National Union of Students （NUS） rs affiliated to most unfversities and colleges in the UK. When you register with an institution， you will automatically be issued with an NUS card and a student identity card. Your NUS card will allow you to save money on such things as public transport， cinema and theater tickets， and clothes from leading chain stores. Some local shops in your area will also give you lower prices if you show our card-your institution's students' union will give you a list of shops that do this.　　You will also quality for an International Student ldentity Card （ISIC）， which can be used for discount rates on Flights and international rail travel. For tr~vel within the UK， a student coach'card or rail card will entitle you to a one-third discount on most fares.　　Both NUS and ISIC cards offer a range of added benefits， including legal advice and students services. The NUS is planning new electronic services for all students at universities and colleges， including free e~mail addresses and discounted online shopping. You can keep up to date with these plans at www.nus.org.uk.　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>本书分为8个单元共32篇文章，涉及学生经常接触到的方方面面。选材广泛，包括多篇报刊阅读内容，确保语言的地道纯正。每篇文章后面都跟有相应练习。让学生们可以随时检查学习内容。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
