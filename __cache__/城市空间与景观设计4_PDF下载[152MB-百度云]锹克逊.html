All over the world, people dependant on TV and computer screens seem to crave public spaces more than ever. Meanwhile, community governments and private developers are increasingly committed to building meaningful public spaces as requisites for municipal and commercial prosperity. This universal appeal of spaces where people can gather continues to inspire new parks, plazas, atriums, and mixed-use complexes, as well as whole new people- oriented neighborhoods and communities.<br/>　　The shaping and reshaping of public spaces, dramatically illustrated in the first three Urban Spaces volumes, is explored further in Urban Spaces No. 4. The Urban Land Institute has again cooperated with Visual Reference Publications to co-sponsor this fourth showcase of urban spaces designed by leading architects, landscape architects, urban designers, and planners. As in all the previous Urban Spaces books, architectural journalist John Morris Dixon, FAIA, explains the design challenges and accomplishments of these outstanding projects.<br/>　　Urban Spaces No. 4 is a thoughtfully annotated tour of diverse projects throughout the world. On these lavishly illustrated color pages, you will gather invaluable insights into the planning and design of such forward-looking developments as a downtown sports complex in Memphis, an innovative mixed-use development in Manila, a network of new outdoor spaces for Hangzhou in China, an innovative retail-entertainment complex in Las Vegas, a highway transformation project in Minneapolis, a new high-rise neighborhood in Manhattan, an imaginative redevelopment program for Fort Worth, and a lively entertainment center in Tokyo. The latest approaches to community planning are demonstrated in several new communities in Florida, a cluster of park-linked villages in California, and new commercial cores for towns in Arkansas and Texas.<br/><br/>作者简介：<br/>    John Morris Dixon,FAIA，An architecture graduate of M.I.T., John Morris Dixon left the drafting room in 1960 to pursue a career as an architectural editor. He was chief editor of Progressive Architecture from 1972 through 1995, a period during which the magazine was a particularly influential force in architecture worldwide. Some of the firms represented in this book first won wide recognition as winners of the P/A Awards program or through articles in P/A. <br/>　　A Fellow of the American Institute of Architects, Dixon has been chair of the AIA's Committee on Design and has twice served on its Institute Honors jury. He has been a member of numerous awards juries and has judged major design competitions. He has been a member of architect selection panels for institutions such as the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Milwaukee Art Museum. He is currently a peer review panelist for the U.S. General Services Administration. <br/>　　Dixon was the editor of the three previous Urban Spaces volumes. Articles by him have recently appeared in such publications as Architecture, Architectural Record, Competitions, and Office insight. He is now writing a book on the evolution of architecture from the 1950s to the present.</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
