At the same time, more and more students are coming from other countries to Chinese universities to further their studies. We've noticed that in terms of both knowledge transfer and intercultural communication, the English language has played an indispensable role. Furthermore, it is the interest of these students to have a smooth transition from one system to another, for their credits to transfer, and for them to immerse themselves in the new environment as quickly as possible. To this end, more and more Chinese schools are offering courses delivered bilingually or in English to enhance students' international outlook.　　One of the greatest challenges in offering Chinese students a course in English is finding a suitable textbook: the textbook must seriously consider what students have done in their high schools; it must meet the national and local official course standards; and it should resonate with significant international flavors so as to benefit students.</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
