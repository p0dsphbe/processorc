Presenting yourself　　At events where you have a chance to make new-contacts， take a proactive approach. Go in with an attitude that says you're going to participate： you're going to be willing to go up and introduce yourself to people and start conversations. It takes guts to approach strangers， but if you do it with charm， those you meet will be impressed by your sociability.　　The first move you make in a meeting is the salutation-a handshake， or a "good morning". A warm， cheerful greeting， in a well-modulated voice， sets the tone for the start of a good impression. The words are only 7 percent of your communication. 93 percent is in your tone of voice and your body-language.　　First here come the handshake， greeting and introduction. Handshakes should be simple-extend right hand and grasp gently but firmly. If your nerves cause you to get wet palms， carry a handkerchiefin your pocket and wipe your hand before you do the meet and greet. The greeting should be short and simple， making certain you listen for the other person's name.　　Fine-tune and rehearse your self-introduction， a 10-second or less sound-byte introduction that includes your first and last name and a snippet of background information to kindle conversation.　　Introducing others will make you seem gracious and well connected， but be sure to follow the proper protocol. In social situations the order in which you introduce two people is based on gender and age （women and older people first）. In business settings the order is deternuned by rank.　　When you do this， you'd better think of it as a circle. Introduce the lower-ranking person to the higher-ranking person， then reverse the order， so you say each person's name two times. Try to add an interesting tidbit to start the conversation.　　If you were introducing Mrs. Smith， a vice president of the company， to Mr. Jones， a junior associate， for example， you might say： "Mrs. Smith， I would like to introduce you to Mr. Jones， a junior associate. Mr. Jones， this is Mrs. Smith. Mr. Jones just returned from Thailand."　　If you're unsure who the more important person is， default to the gender and age guideline. Don't panic if you forget a name， Most people will be happy to remind you and appreciate the introduction.　　IV. Listening and speaking strategies　　To nail the good impression you're trying to make， another tip when you are in this setting is not to make the conversation all about you. You want to engage the other person in conversation， making certain to use his/her name for emphasis. You can， of course， talk about yourself， but don't make the whole conversation all about you-and keep stories short. Here are some specific strategies to follow.　　When trying to make a good first impression you should speak clearly in order to effectively communicate with the people you are meeting. You should attempt to talk at a moderate pace， enunciate， and use appropriate volume and tone. Also make sure to use proper grammar and avoid using slang. Remember， if you are trying to make a lasting first impression it is important that people can comprehend what you are saying， or they will more than likely to disregard the meeting all together.　　Another helpful hint when you are trying to make a good first impression is to use the other person's name frequently when you are conversing. This will help make the conversation feel more personal and you are more likely to leave a good initial impression. The person you are speaking to will feel that you are paying attention and feel they are important enough to remember their name right away.　　Also try to avoid joking too much on a first encounter. Though humorous anecdotes can sometimes lighten the mood or break the ice， keep in mind people differ on what they think is funny. If you unknowingly tell a joke that someone else finds offensive or in bad taste， you can ruin your chance at a good first impression. If you absolutely feel the need to be humorous， try something conservative and light hearted that is likely to be found funny by everyone listening.　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>　　新基点（NEW BENCH MARK）全国高等院校商务英语专业本科系列规划教材由对外经济贸易大学出版社联合对外经济贸易大学、广东外语外贸大学、上海对外经贸大学、东北财经大学、上海财经大学等学校的骨干教授编写而成。　　2007年国家教育部批准设立了商务英语本科专业。为促进商务英语学科建设，适应教学改革和创新的需要，对外经济贸易大学出版社特组织编写了“新基点”系列教材。本系列教材体现商务英语专业新教学特点和要求，是面向二十一世纪的一套全新的立体化商务英语教材，主要适用于全国各高等院校商务英语专业本科学生。　　本系列教材旨在培养具有扎实的英语基本功，掌握国际商务基础理论和知识，具备较高的人文素养，善于跨文化交流与沟通，能适应经济全球化，具备国际竞争力的复合型英语人才。共由语言技能、商务知识、人文素养三个子系列组成。　　语言技能子系列包括商务英语综合教程1-4册、商务英语听说1-4册、商务英语写作1-4册、商务英语翻译1-2册。　　商务知识子系列介绍商务基础理论和商务实践的具体知识，主要包括经济学原理、管理学原理、商法导论、跨文化交际导论、国际贸易实务、营销学等主干教材。　　人文素养子系列主要包括语言学导论、英美国家概况、欧洲文化、英美文学选读、英美散文选读、大学英汉翻译、大学汉英翻译等核心教材。　　上述的每套子系列教材都自成体系，合在一起又形成了有机的整体。本套教材不是封闭的，而是随着教学模式、课程设置和课时的变化，不断推出新的教材。对外经济贸易大学出版社旨在广泛调动社会智力资源，与时俱进、推陈出新，推出一套适合新兴商务英语专业本科学生的系列教材。　　编撰者们不仅具有丰富的语言教学经验，而且获得工商管理、经济学等商科专业的硕士、博士学位，具备商务活动的实践经验。他们集教学经验和专业背景于一身，这正是本套商务英语系列教材编撰质量的有力保证。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
