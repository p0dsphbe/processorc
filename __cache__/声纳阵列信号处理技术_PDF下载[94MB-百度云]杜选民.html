阵列信号处理是现代声纳设备的核心功能之一。通过接收阵列的信号处理，可以获取空间指向性增益，提高空间分辨和干扰抑制能力，实现对目标的检测与跟踪、方位与距离估计；通过发射阵列的信号处理，可以获取具有一定时延差或相位差的阵元信号，从而形成指向性发射波束，提高声源级；通过空-时自适应处理，可以提高对弱目标的检测能力。近年来，声纳技术不断发展，出现了多线列阵声纳、连续波声纳、MIMO声纳等新体制声纳以及自适应盲处理、时反处理、矢量信号处理、鲁棒性波束形成、模基信号处理等新型处理算法，这些都是声纳阵列信号处理的发展与丰富。本书深入、系统地介绍了可应用于实际声纳设备的阵列信号处理技术，在简单的原理接收基础上又大量的计算机模拟仿真及湖、海试实际数据的处理结果。另外本书有较大篇幅的声纳阵列信号处理领域的新技术介绍。
