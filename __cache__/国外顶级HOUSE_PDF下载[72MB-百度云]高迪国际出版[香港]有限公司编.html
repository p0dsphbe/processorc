    architecture is a material and social art
that is the most profound of all the arts because we live inside
it.
    the danish philosopher kierkegaard once
observed, "the highest and most beautiful things in life are not to
be heard about, nor read about,nor seen but, if one will, are to be
lived."architecture, designed to be "lived" in, or experienced, as
part of the fabric of a larger community and as expressions of the
needs of its inhabitants, can produce an unexpected set of
relationships and opportunities that become manifested as social
and spatial events.
    it is the experiential quality of these
events,the juxtaposing and arrangement of objects and forms that,
when precisely crafted and well positioned, can produce
extraordinarily beautiful meanings that are recognized within the
participant or community.
    the meaning of the works revealed in this
book,fascinating house is conveyed in each ofthe projects moments
of complexity, diversity,beauty, and richness. within these
moments,architecture emerges as an art form, critically engaged
with the visual, social, and historical culture of which it is an
active part.
