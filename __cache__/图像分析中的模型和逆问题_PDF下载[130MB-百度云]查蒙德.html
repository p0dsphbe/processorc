this book fulfills a need in the field of computer science research and education. it is not intended for professional mathematicians, but it undoubtedly deals with applied mathematics. most of the expectations of the topic are fulfilled: precision, exactness, completeness, and excellent references to the original historical works. however, for the sake of read-ability, many demonstrations are omitted. it is not a book on practical image processing, of which so many abound, although all that it teaches is directly concerned with image analysis and image restoration. it is the perfect resource for any advanced scientist concerned with a better un-derstanding of the theoretical models underlying the methods that have efficiently solved numerous issues in robot vision and picture processing.
