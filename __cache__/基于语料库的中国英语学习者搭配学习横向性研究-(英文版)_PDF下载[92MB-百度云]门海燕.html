由门海燕所*的《基于语料库的中国英语学习者搭配学习横向性研究(英文版)》基于中国学习者英语语料库，以三组英语水平所写的作文为研究对象，具体研究其在动词 名词，形容词 名词和名词 名词三类搭配中的使用，发现随着英语水平的提高，中国英语学习者的动名搭配学习出现滞后；而其他两种类型的搭配随着英语水平的提高而提高；动词 名词搭配滞后与高水平英语学习者动词词汇量增长有关，即高水平英语学习者近义词集合中词汇增长越密集，错误就越多。研究结果不但有助于我们进一步了解学习者搭配习得，而且对如何有效地学、教搭配具有很大的启示意义。<br/>本书可供应用语言学或语料库语言学领域的研究者、英语老师及英语语言学专业的研究牛阅读参考。
