It is used to cure illness as well as for self-defense and is a comprehensive form of culture of the human body.Wushu enjoys a long history and great popularity in China. Thanks to its uniqueness and charisma originating from traditional Oriental culture, Wushu is captivating the attention of more and more people in other nations.As one of the earliest and long-lasting sports, Wushu has developed its own characteristics over time. Major characteristics are listed below:Because of its long history incorporating differences in culture, ideology, region and usages, Wushu has developed into a great variety of schools and styles. While some schools emphasize the use of fist and hand technique, others emphasize leg technique and footwork. Some take interest in the variation of acts whereas others prefer simplicity.Some focus on keeping opponents at arm's and leg's length while others like to fight in close contact. The assortment of schools and styles displays the colorful features of Wushu and gratifies the various needs of people.Wushu includes the use of many weapons. Chinese ancients named the Wushu arsenal the "Eighteen Arms", but there are many more in use. Almost all fights are accompanied by weapon usage of one kind or another. The combination of fist fights and weapon usage allows for a fuller and more efficient application of Wushu skills while sharpening the insight of combat and control and enriching the program of Wushu exercise.</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
