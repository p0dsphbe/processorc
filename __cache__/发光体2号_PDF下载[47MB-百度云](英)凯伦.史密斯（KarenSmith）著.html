scene since the early 1990s. She has lived in China for twenty
years during which time she has contributed to numerous
international and domestic publications and exhibition catalogues,
both for individual artists and group exhibitions.
Her personal books include several monographs on China’s leading
artists, and the historical compendium Nine Lives: The Birth 　　of
Avant-Garde Art in New China, which examines the careers of nine
founding fathers of China’s new art movement which began in
1985.
　　In her capacity as curator, Smith regularly produces exhibitions
in China and abroad.                                    </p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
