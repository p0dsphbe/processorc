this textbook is compiled primarily for overseas students in china who plan to develop a career in some field of medicine. there are twelve chapters that determined by the needs of medicine majors including the basis of biomechanics; vibration, wave and sound; the motion of fluid; phenomena on liquid surfaces; electric field; magnetic field, direct current; geometric optics; wave optics; laser; x-rays; and nuclear physics.
