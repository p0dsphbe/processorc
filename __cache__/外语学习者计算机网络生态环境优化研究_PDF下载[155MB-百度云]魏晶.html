In 2004,   "College English Curriculum Requirements（For Trial Implementation） " was issued by the Ministry of Education, China, proposing   "Computer-and-Classroom-Based English Teaching Mode" . The new teaching reform is to improve the traditional English teaching mode and build the network-based autonomous foreign language leaming mode by establishing three-dimensional network-based multimedia teaching system. Thus the position of computer networks is defined as an indispensable part of foreign language teaching, to be brought up for the first time in the history of foreign language education. Computer networks are for the first time taken seriously and from then on the integration of computer networks into foreign language curriculum truly began.　　As the computer networks technology and foreign language teaching belong to two different disciplines, the integration of computer networks into foreign language curriculum will inevitably lead to the changes of traditional teaching factors, such as its teaching model, teaching objectives, methods, tools, materials, curriculum and others. The changes of these factors correspondingly bring about the changes of teaching concepts. Obviously, these changes have broken the balance of foreign language learners' traditional ecological environment. The imbalanced learning environment will undoubtedly witness the occurrence of many disorders. Interdisciplinary integration is a tendency of the scientific development in the 21st century. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt a perspective of constructing a new leaming environment to reexamine foreign language learning under the frame of ecology, the principles of which can offer feasible solutions to the imbalanced problems. It aims to construct and optimize foreign language learners' ecological environment under the background of computer networks, by making it into a new ecological balance featured with the harmonious, dynamic, fiexible and healthy development.　　The current study is based on the constructing foreign language learners' ecological environment under the background of network technologies, which decides the main methods of theoretical researches. In other words, under the frame of certain theories, theoretical demonstrations are deduced by network technology, foreign language teaching, constructivism, ecology, etc., in order to create a mode of constructing and optimizing the ecological environment for foreign language learners. On this macro level, other qualitative and quantitative research methods like literature review, statistical analysis are also adopted just to prove the appropriateness and preciseness of the mode. The concrete demonstrations are on two levels: macro-level-logical reasoning on theoretical level, micro-level-the level of teaching practice and mode construction.　　First of all, with the reasoning of  "network technology and foreign language teaching" , by the analysis of multimedia network technology as well as foreign language teaching research data and the critical evaluation of the overall literature review, the study tries to draw the following conclusion: the integration of network technology into foreign language teaching has resulted in the changes of students' learning environment and the imbalances in different degrees.　　Secondly, constructivism and ecology serve as the theoretical perspectives for optimizing the integrated environment of network technology and foreign language learning. Moreover, on the basis ofliterature review, fundamental principles and requirements for its environmental optimization are proposed to construct optimization mode. In other words, the research methods such as literature review and statistical analysis, etc., taking  "network technology"  as the breakthrough point, are used for the research of ecological environment, which helps to reach the dynamic balance within the mode ofoptimized ecological learning environment.　　The demonstration process on these two levels cannot be separated apart with striking distinctions but an cntircty interrelated intrinsically and harmoniously. The fulfillment of its theme structure requircs a macro perspective. However, the study of specific patterns or modes requires both qualitative and quantitative research methods of all kinds, including not only objective methods like literature review, statistical analysis, etc., but also critical analysis of fact-based materials and representative viewpoints.　　……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>基于计算机网络技术的外语学习已经成为当前高等学校外语学习的辅助实践和喜欢方法，本书以生态学原理为理论基础对计算机网络环境下外语学习环境进行研究和探讨，在实证研究和实地考察的基础上，提出对计算机网络环境下外语学习生态环境进行优化的原则、基本要求，并将其优化成一种综合、动态、平衡的学习环境。本书共分七章，运用生态学理论中生态位和生态平衡系统理论来优化失调的四大学习环境，提出优化的基本要求和原则。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
