She meets them at the airport and takes them to their hotel. She has assigned rooms and after dinner she gathers them for a meeting in the meeting room to tell their itinerary, and to inform them of the risks and dangers they may come across.    D： Good evening, everyone. Let me welcome you to Shanghai again and to the Holiday Inn which will be your home for the next two weeks. We hope that yonr rooms ar a in good order and if you have any difficulties, please just let us know. It is better to go through us rather than dealing with the hotel administration yourself, since we know them very well and have good relations with them.    Tourist A： No problem.    D ： Now, you should all have an itinerary of your trip and a fact sheet about cultural awareness. I would first of all like to talk about the Chinese culture and what you should expect. Hopefully you should have already read something about the Chinese culture before you came, but I think I should go over what I think are the most important aspects. The most frequent difficulties foreigners have with the Chinese culture, as you can see in the fact sheet, are： staring, hellos, solicitous salespeople and zealous shopkeepers, show traffic, over friendliness, and misunderstandings. First, staring and hellos. This is worse outside of Shanghai, but you will find that people will stand and stare at you as you go by. They may also say hello. This will seem amusing at first, but after a while it will lose its novelty, especially when you feel tired, and if you have a low tolerance level, you will start to feel annoyed.     ……</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>全书共分为三大部分，以56段实用会话的形式展开，内容涵盖建立商务关系、会展、公司招待、询盘、报盘等方面。每段对话后给出重难点词汇和句子注释，书后附“词汇拓展”、“句式展示”、“商务单证”。 </p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
