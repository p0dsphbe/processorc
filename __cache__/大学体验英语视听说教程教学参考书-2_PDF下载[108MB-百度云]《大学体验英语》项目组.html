  插图：One recent survey has found that average salaries at U.S. companies have risen by less than 2%so far this year. In these tough times people may be afraid to ask for raises, but Jill Schlesinger saysit's all in how you do it.Jill believes even though base salaries have stagnated, there could be ways to beef up yourcompensation. According to Jill, the best way to broach the subject of a salary raise is to talk faceto face with your boss instead of emailing him/her. You must present your list of accomplishments,focus on the money you have saved or made for the company and the additional responsibilitiesyou have assumed since the recession began.The alternative ways to get your compensation include negotiating a future raise or settinga date for a future discussion. If your boss refuses to give you more money, try to ask for otherthings, such as some more vacation, a paid education, a better title or a nicer office.Jill suggests threes Don'ts, namely, don't emphasize how hard you work; don't threaten toleave and don't flaunt your other offers to your boss.</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
