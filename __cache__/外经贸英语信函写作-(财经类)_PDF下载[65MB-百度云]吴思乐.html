Completeness （完整）Business letters should avoid incompleteness.  A business communication should include all the necessary information. It is essential to check the message carefully before it is sent out to see that all the matters are discussed, and all the questions are answered.2. Concreteness（具体）Concreteness means making the message specific, definite and vivid. Business letters should avoid being too general. In general letters, everything seems to be mentioned but actually few are fully expounded. You should use specific facts and figures, vivid and image-building words.3.

When you are sure about what you want to say, say it in plain and simple words. Short, familiar, conversational and straight-forward English is what is needed for business letters.4. Conciseness （简洁，简明）Conciseness is often considered to be the most important writing principle.  It means saying things in the fewest possible words. To achieve this, try to avoid wordiness or redundancy. Clearness and conciseness often go hand-in-hand, and the elimination of wordy business jargon can help to make a letter clearer and more concise at the same time. A concise letter is not necessarily a short one. Sometimes, perhaps a letter dealing with a multiplicity of matters cannot avoid being long. Generally speaking, you will gain in clearness and conciseness by writing short sentences rather than long ones.A letter can be</p>]<p><h2>内容简介</h2></p>[<p>本书是21世纪高职高专规划教材。本书以商品进出口贸易程序为主线，主要介绍进出口双方在合同的洽谈和履行过程中进行的往来函电交流用语和相关知识。主要内容有信函写作基本知识、业务磋商的准备、业务磋商的主要环节、交易的达成、主要交易条款的磋商、合同履行过程中的争议及争议的解决等6个模块，具体包括了询盘、报盘、还盘、接受与确认、订单、寄送合同、支付、信用证、包装、运输、保险、申诉、索赔、理赔等进出口贸易各个环节。本书内容全面，介绍内容深入浅出，侧重应用性和实践性，既可作为高职高专对外经贸领域各专业学生的教材，也可供从事外经贸工作的人员阅读和使用。</p>]<p><h2>目录</h2></p>
