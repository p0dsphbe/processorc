After 20 generations, individual variance is very small as their genes have been purified. Inbreeding coefficient （F） is often used to represent swain purity. First generation of sibling inbreeding can reduce heterozygosis by 19%, which means homozygosis is increased by 19%. Inbreeding coefficient could reach 98.6% in theory within 20 generations However, more methods to examine the genetic homozygosis are needed to determine strain purity in addition to inbreeding coefficient. Inbred strains are used to be called 'pure strains'. There have been 250 inbred strains for albino mice till 1980. Development of inbred strains for experimental animals like albino rats and albino mice have greatly promoted biological and medical experimental research, especially tumor research.（2） Mutant strains: Mutant strains can be established by mutation of individual gene, introduction of certain gene or multiple backcross to keep the genetic features. These individuals have same genetic defect or pathosis, such as dwarf, atrichia, obesity, amyotrophy, caligo lentis and retina degeneration.Currently avaible mutant strains with certain diseases are listed: anaemia mouse, tumor mouse, leukaemia mouse, diabetic mouse, hypertension mouse and athymic mouse, etc.（3） F1 hybrid: The first generation offsprings of two inbred strains is called F1 hybrid. It has both the features of inbred strains and the hybrid ascendancy. F1 hybrid has merits like vigorous vitality, high reproductive rate, fast growth, strong body constitution and disease resistance. It has same experimental effects as inbred animals. F1 hybrid is also call systemic hybrid animals.（4） Closed population: It is the population relatively maintaining the same blood relationship developed by random breeding within one strain for mo</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
