The caves are large in number and scattered in a widerange. A safeguard manual and automatic monitoring system has played an important part insafeguarding the cultural relics of the Mogao Grottoes, prevented several thefts of cultural relicsand illegal cases within the protection zone, and created a good environment and conveniencefor visitors.3. 4 Visitor investigation and monitoring at the Mogao GrottoesThe opening up of the Mogao Grottoes began in late 1970s. Recently, the visitors to MogaoGrottoes have increased in an accelerated way, the high season in a year and rush hour in a daydouble the pressure on the conservation and opening up of the Mogao Grottoes. This requires usto preserve the cultural heritage effectively and satisfy the visitors to the largest extent at thesame time. So we have to improve our conservation level of culture relics, and meanwhile moni-tor and investigate the needs of the visitors. Therefore, we launched the research project on visi-tor capacity at the Mogao Grottoes. We know the dynamic information about the changes of themarket and structure of visitors precisely and timely, thus get the reliable evidences for makingreasonable visitor management through regular and special visitor investigations and reservationsystem ; in addition, the feedback of the visitors is also a reference for understanding the needsof the visitors, promoting services, and improving service installations.Based on multi-time special questionnaires, we set up manual and network reservation sys-tem, which is not only useful for the conversation and opening up of the caves, but also for im-proving visiting environment and promoting visiting quality. The reservation system has been ac-cepted gradual</p>]<p><h2>本书特色</h2></p>[<p>
