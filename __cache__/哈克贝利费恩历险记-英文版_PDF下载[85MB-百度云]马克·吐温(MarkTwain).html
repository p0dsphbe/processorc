Afterwards Jimsaid the witches betwitched him and put him in a trance, androde him all over the State. and then set him under the treesagain and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it. Andnext time Jim told it he said they rode him down to NewOrleans; and, after that. every time he told it he spread itmore and more. till by and by he said they rode him all overthe world. and tired him most to death, and his back was allover saddle-boils. Jim was monstrous proud about it. and hegot so he wouldn't hardly notice the other niggers. Niggerswould come miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was morelooked up to than any nigger in that country. Strange niggerswould stand with their mouths open and look him all over,same as if he was a wonder.
